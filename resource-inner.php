                            It’s not always easy to put food on the table. In fact, many families struggle. According to
                            the United States Department of Agriculture, 10.2% of households were food insecure in 2021
                            — roughly 13.5 million people.

                            Consider donating non-perishable items to your local food bank. Or, if you can, think about
                            making a monetary donation to help fight hunger and erase food insecurity.

                            It’s a simple, small gesture with a mighty impact. Not only could it brighten their day, but
                            it may even inspire a chain reaction of repeat kindness.

                            Sometimes the most valuable present of all is the gift of time. Your presence, whether it be
                            with loved ones or someone in need, can go a long way toward making a tangible impact on
                            someone’s life. Consider volunteering a few hours of your time to a local soup kitchen or
                            homeless shelter.
