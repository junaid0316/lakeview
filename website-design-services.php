                        <p class="wlp">An example of a web service could be an online booking system for a hotel
                            website. This service allows users to check room availability, make reservations, and
                            process payments directly through the website. The booking system would integrate seamlessly
                            with the website's design and functionality, providing a convenient and efficient experience
                            for both the business and its customers.</p>

                        <h4 class="abh4">Web Design: Freelancing or Not?</h4>
                        <p class="wlp">Web design can be both freelanced and offered by agencies or in-house teams.
                            Freelance web designers work independently and may offer their services to multiple clients
                            on a project basis. On the other hand, agencies and in-house teams typically provide web
                            design services as part of a broader range of offerings and may handle larger projects or
                            ongoing website maintenance for clients.</p>

                            including:</p>
                        <ul class="cntntul">
                            <li><strong>Aesthetic Appeal:</strong> Creating visually appealing websites that attract and
                                engage visitors.</li>
                            <li><strong>User Experience (UX):</strong> Ensuring websites are easy to use, navigate, and
                                understand, leading to a positive user experience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Brand Representation:</strong> Reflecting the brand's identity, values, and
                                personality through design elements and aesthetics.</li>

                                allowing users to accomplish their goals efficiently.</li>
